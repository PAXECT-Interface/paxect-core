### 🔄 Updates & Maintenance

PAXECT Core Complete follows an **open contribution model**.

- Updates, bugfixes, and improvements depend on **community and maintainer availability**.
- There is **no fixed release schedule** — stability and determinism are prioritized over speed.
- Enterprises and contributors are encouraged to submit issues or pull requests for any enhancements.
- The project owner focuses on innovation and architectural guidance rather than continuous support.

In short: updates arrive when they are ready — verified, deterministic, and tested across platforms.
