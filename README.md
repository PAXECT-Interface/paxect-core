# PAXECT — Reliable Data Exchange Across Operating Systems and Programming Languages

PAXECT is an open-source solution for deterministic, secure transport, archiving, and processing of technical data (files, streams, logs, telemetry, updates) in complex, multi-platform IT environments.  
PAXECT enables organizations to safely and reproducibly exchange data between different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD, ARM, embedded, mobile) and programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, and more).

The platform delivers a robust container format (`.freq`), plug-&-play extensions (encryption, language bindings, performance tuning), and a privacy-first architecture with no telemetry or external data streams.  
Designed for compliance, scalability, and seamless integration into enterprise workflows, PAXECT offers transparent governance, Apache-2.0 licensing, and a clear roadmap for both OSS and commercial modules.
