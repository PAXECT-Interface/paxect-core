# PAXECT — Reliable Data Exchange Across Operating Systems and Programming Languages

PAXECT is an open-source platform for deterministic, secure transport and archiving of technical data (files, streams, logs, telemetry, updates) in complex, multi-platform environments. It provides a stable container format **(.freq)**, a **plug-and-play** extension model (encryption, language bindings, performance tuning), and a privacy-first architecture with no telemetry or external data flows.

PAXECT enables reproducible exchange across operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD, ARM/embedded, mobile) and integrates with programming languages including Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Rust, Go, Java, C#, PHP, and Ruby.

**Core values**
- **Deterministic** — Same input + configuration ⇒ bit-identical output (audit/compliance/regression).
- **Multi-OS & multi-language** — Native support across OS families with broad language bindings.
- **Extensible** — Plug-and-play modules for encryption, observability, performance, and extra bindings.
- **Privacy & security** — No tracking or cloud dependency; optional AES-based encryption; explicit integrity checks.
- **Transparency** — Apache-2.0 licensing, public roadmap, compatibility matrix, and benchmarks. *Zero AI.*

**Why PAXECT**
- Reliable exchange and archiving of technical data in heterogeneous environments.  
- Compliance & auditability via deterministic, reproducible processing steps.  
- Rapid integration through modular design and broad platform/language support.  
- Privacy-first approach aligned with modern regulations.
