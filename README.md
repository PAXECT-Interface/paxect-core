# PAXECT — Deterministic, Secure Data Container for Multi-OS, Multi-Language & Enterprise Integrations

PAXECT is an open-source toolkit for deterministic transport, archiving, and processing of technical data (files, streams, logs, telemetry, updates) across heterogeneous IT environments.  
The project delivers a powerful container format (`.freq`), plug-&-play plugins (encryption, language bindings, performance tuning), and a privacy-first architecture.  
Compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD, embedded, ARM, and mobile; integrations for Python, Node.js, Go, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Rust, and more.

## TL;DR

- **Deterministic:** bit-identical results for identical input & options—ideal for audits and compliance.
- **Multi-OS/CPU:** Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM, BSD, mobile (compatibility matrix available).
- **Plug-&-play plugins:** AES Secure, Polyglot bindings, SelfTune performance—optional, zero overhead when disabled.
- **Privacy-first:** no telemetry, local processing, opt-in logging/audit.
- **Enterprise-ready:** clear governance, licensing, trademark policy, OSS vs. Pro roadmap.

## Why PAXECT?
- **Reliable data exchange** between diverse OSes and CPUs.
- **Reproducible archiving** for audit, regression tests, compliance.
- **Polyglot integrations:** one container, one API, many languages.
- **Extensible via plugins:** encryption, observability, extra language bindings.
- **Security & privacy:** no AI/profiling, no tracking, all local.
